# Long Range Fixed Wing Autonomous Blood Delivery UAV

## Problem Statement
Over 12,000 people a day in India die due to the unavailability of blood. Many regions, especially remote and rural areas, lack adequate medical infrastructure. More than 40 districts in India do not have a single blood bank. [1] During natural disasters, transporting medical supplies becomes one of the greatest challenges, often requiring hard-to-access manned helicopters.

## Proposed Solution
We propose a “Long Range Fixed Wing Autonomous UAV” (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) designed for efficient, long-distance delivery of blood and medical supplies. Unlike rotary-wing drones, our fixed-wing UAV can fly for extended periods and carry heavier payloads over greater distances. This UAV will be equipped with an autonomous navigation system and a parachute delivery mechanism to ensure safe and precise delivery of packages to inaccessible or disaster-stricken areas.

## Goals and Objectives
•	Develop a reliable UAV capable of long-range autonomous flights.

•	Ensure timely and efficient delivery of blood and medical supplies to remote and disaster-affected areas.

•	Enhance the accessibility of critical medical resources, reducing mortality rates due to the unavailability of blood.

•	Demonstrate the viability of using fixed-wing UAVs for humanitarian and medical logistics

## Target Audience
The primary beneficiaries of our solution are:

•	Healthcare providers in remote and rural areas.

•	Government and non-governmental organizations involved in disaster relief and medical logistics.

•	Patients in need of urgent blood transfusions and other critical medical supplies.

## Key Features
•	Long-Range Flight Capability: Designed to cover distances up to 100 kilometers, ensuring access to hard-to-reach areas.

•	High altitude flights: Electric BLDC motors with higher thrust can be used to deliver packages in high altitude hard to access locations.

•	Good Payload Capacity: Capable of carrying medical supplies, including blood units and essential medications.

•	Autonomous Navigation: Equipped with GPS and advanced flight control systems for autonomous operation.

•	Parachute Delivery System: Ensures safe and precise delivery of packages to the ground.

•	STOL Capabilities: Built to take off and land in small spaces with hand launch and hand catch ability.

•	Emergency Stall Parachute: With the use of Barometric altimeter and accelerometer we can detect when the aircraft go below stall speed and deploy parachute to save the aircraft and the valuable medical supplies

## Technical Approach
•	Hardware: Fixed-wing UAV for enhanced flight efficiency and range. Equipped with high-capacity batteries and efficient propulsion systems.

•	Navigation: Equipped with high accuracy accelerometer and gyroscope with Global positioning system.

•	Software: Autonomous flight software utilizing GPS for navigation and real-time flight adjustments.

•	Communication: Utilizes NRF24L01 transmitter and receiver for manual control of aircraft.

•	Delivery Mechanism: Parachute-based delivery system for accurate and safe delivery of medical supplies.

## Expected Outcomes
We anticipate our solution will:

•	Significantly reduce the time required to deliver critical medical supplies to remote areas, potentially saving thousands of lives.

•	Demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using fixed-wing UAVs for medical logistics.

•	Enhance disaster response capabilities, providing rapid delivery of necessary medical supplies during emergencies.

•	Establish a scalable model that can be expanded to other regions and types of deliveries, promoting broader adoption of UAV technology in humanitarian efforts.
